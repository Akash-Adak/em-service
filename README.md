Project Structure:

Maven or Gradle: Use either Maven or Gradle as a build tool to manage dependencies and project structure.
Spring Boot Starter: Include the spring-boot-starter-web dependency to provide essential web development capabilities.
JPA or Hibernate: If you need to interact with a database, choose either JPA (Java Persistence API) or Hibernate as your ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework.
Lombok: Consider using Lombok to reduce boilerplate code, especially for getters, setters, constructors, and equals/hashCode methods.
Entity Class:

Define an Employee entity class with appropriate attributes (e.g., id, firstName, lastName, email, department).
Annotate the class and attributes with JPA annotations (e.g., @Entity, @Id, @GeneratedValue, @Column).
Consider using Lombok's @Data annotation to generate getters, setters, constructors, equals/hashCode methods automatically.
Repository Interface:

Create an EmployeeRepository interface extending JpaRepository<Employee, Long>.
This interface provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the Employee entity.
Service Layer:

Implement an EmployeeService interface with methods for performing business logic related to employees.
Inject the EmployeeRepository into the service class.
Implement methods like saveEmployee, getEmployeeById, getAllEmployees, deleteEmployee.
Controller:

Create an EmployeeController class to handle HTTP requests related to employees.
Inject the EmployeeService into the controller.
Define RESTful endpoints using @RequestMapping or @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping annotations.
Map HTTP requests to corresponding service methods.
Database Connection:

Configure your database connection in application.properties or application.yml.
Provide the database URL, username, and password.
Testing:

Write unit tests for your service and controller classes using JUnit and Mockito.
Test various scenarios, such as saving, retrieving, updating, and deleting employees.
Additional Considerations:

Error Handling: Implement proper error handling using exceptions and custom error responses.
Security: If required, add security measures like authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
Logging: Use logging frameworks like SLF4J and Logback to log information for debugging and monitoring purposes.
Pagination and Sorting: If you're dealing with large datasets, implement pagination and sorting to improve performance.
Data Validation: Validate input data using annotations like @NotNull, @NotBlank, @Size, etc.
